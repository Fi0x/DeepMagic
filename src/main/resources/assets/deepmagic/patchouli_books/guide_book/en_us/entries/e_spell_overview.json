Defining the effect of a Spell can be done in a $(l:e_block_spell_stone)Spell Stone/el. To create a working spell, you need to decide which components you want to use. The available component types are 'Casts', 'Effects' and 'Modifiers'."

To add components to the list in the $(l:e_block_spell_stone)Spell Stone/el GUI, you have to put the required items in the top 5 slots of the GUI and then click the 'Add' button. Once all desired components are added to the list, you can click the 'Bind' button to finalize the Spell."
